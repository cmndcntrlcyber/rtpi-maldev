# DevOps Stack Project Summary

## Architecture Overview

This DevOps stack provides an integrated, self-hosted development environment that combines source control, CI/CD, container management, and virtual workspaces. The architecture follows a microservices approach with Docker containers for easy deployment and management.

### Key Components

1. **Source Control Management**
   - Gitea: A lightweight, self-hosted Git service
   - Features: Issue tracking, pull requests, webhooks, and OAuth2 integration

2. **Continuous Integration & Deployment**
   - Drone Server: Orchestrates CI/CD pipelines
   - Drone Runner: Executes pipeline steps in isolated containers
   - Integration with Gitea via OAuth2

3. **Container Management**
   - Portainer CE: Web-based Docker management interface
   - Features: Container monitoring, stack deployment, and resource management

4. **Virtual Workspaces**
   - Kasm Workspaces: Browser-based containerized applications
   - Kasm Manager: Coordinates workspace sessions
   - Kasm Agent: Executes workspaces
   - Custom workspaces: Postman and DevOps environment

5. **Data Persistence**
   - PostgreSQL: Database for Kasm Workspaces
   - Redis: Caching and session management for Kasm

6. **Network & Access**
   - Nginx: Reverse proxy for unified access to all services
   - SSL/TLS encryption (optional)
   - Subdomain-based routing

7. **Integration**
   - Webhook Handler: Custom service for processing Git webhooks

## Network Flow

1. Users access services through their browser
2. Nginx routes requests to the appropriate service based on subdomain
3. Services communicate with each other over the internal Docker network
4. Drone and Portainer access the Docker socket for container management

## Data Flow

1. Code is committed to Gitea repositories
2. Webhooks trigger CI/CD pipelines in Drone
3. Drone executes build and deployment steps
4. Applications are deployed as containers or in Kasm workspaces
5. Portainer provides monitoring and management capabilities

## Security Model

1. Internal services communicate on a private Docker network
2. External access is controlled via Nginx reverse proxy
3. Authentication is required for all services
4. Secrets are managed via environment variables and Docker secrets
5. SSL/TLS encryption for secure communications (when enabled)

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Drone Runners can be scaled by adding more instances
   - Kasm Agents can be added to support more concurrent workspaces

2. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Resource limits can be adjusted per container
   - Database and Redis can be scaled with more resources

3. **High Availability**
   - Services can be deployed across multiple hosts
   - Database replication for Kasm Workspaces

## Development Workflow

1. Developers access Gitea to manage code repositories
2. Code changes trigger automated CI/CD pipelines in Drone
3. Developers use Kasm workspaces for testing and development
4. Containers are managed and monitored through Portainer
5. Integration points are handled via the webhook service

## Project Structure

The project is organized to maintain a clean separation of concerns:

- **docker-compose.yml**: Main service definitions
- **.env**: Environment variable configuration
- **config/**: Service-specific configuration files
- **scripts/**: Helper scripts for setup, backup, and maintenance
- **custom/**: Custom Dockerfiles and integrations
- **data/**: Persistent data (mounted as volumes)

## Future Expansion Possibilities

1. **Monitoring**: Add Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and monitoring
2. **Logging**: Integrate ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
3. **Security Scanning**: Add container vulnerability scanning
4. **Backup**: Implement automatic scheduled backups
5. **Registry**: Add a private Docker registry service
6. **Documentation**: Integrate a wiki or documentation system

## Requirements

- Linux server with Docker Engine and Docker Compose
- Minimum 4GB RAM, recommended 8GB+
- 20GB+ disk space
- Ports 80, 443, and 222 available

## Recommendations for Production

1. Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
2. Set up regular backups
3. Implement monitoring and alerting
4. Secure sensitive environment variables
5. Configure firewall rules
6. Implement proper user access controls
